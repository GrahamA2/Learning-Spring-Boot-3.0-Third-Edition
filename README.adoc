== Learning Spring Boot 3.0: 3rd Edition (Packt)

*Spring Boot 3* is the hottest ticket in town when it comes to building Java apps. In this book, you’ll learn how to leverage powerful databases and Spring Boot's highly adopted Spring MVC web technology. This practical guide will help you get up and running with all the latest features of Spring Boot 3.

The book starts by helping you build a simple app and then shows you how to secure, test, bundle and deploy it to production. Next, you’ll focus on the ability to go ‘native’ and release your app on GraalVM. Later chapters cover reactive programming and explore scalable web controllers and data operations. You’ll gain in-depth insights into developer tools, security, and deployment. In addition to this, you’ll learn how to secure your application using both routes and method-based rules.

By the end of this book, you’ll be able to apply what you’ve learned to any Spring Boot related problem.
